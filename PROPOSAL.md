<h1> 
  Amith's CS 126 Final Project Proposal 
</h1>

**Proposal:**
For my final project, I want to recreate the game Flappy Bird. Flappy Bird was a popular mobile game in 2013-2014 until it was removed from the app/play store but many spinoff versions are still available today. If you are not familiar with the game, a player controls a bird by tapping/clicking and has to maneuver through pipes to score points. If the bird hits a pipe it dies and the game is over. I want to implement the gameâ€™s main functionality first, such as playing through a loop until the player loses while keeping track of their score. Then I would implement a second game mode called challenge mode where the screen progresses even faster. If I were to finish early, I would add powerups to the game or create multiple game modes. I also like the fact that this project is very interactive with the user since it is a game.

**Background:**
I played the original version of flappy bird back when it was a mega hit and before it was deleted. I think it would be cool to make my own version of a childhood game. This would also be a nice display of my growth in programming.

**Project Timeline:**
By the end of Week 1 I will have implemented most of the main gameplay where the user clicks the screen to move their player through pipes.
By the end of Week 2 I will finish implementing the gameplay by fine-tuning the gravity feature and implement the start screen and the option to go back to the start screen once the player has lost.
By the end of Week 3 I will have implemented the second game mode and the option for the user to select it before starting a game. I will also add a leaderboard and a menu to change skins and backgrounds.
If I were to finish early, some stretch goals I could go for are adding powerups and a reverse mode.
