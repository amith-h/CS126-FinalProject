Overview: My project is a recreation of the 2013 Hit Mobile Game Flappy Bird. It emulates the gameplay of Flappy Bird and has some additional features too, such as a challenge mode where the game speed and gravity are increased and a customization screen where the user can change the bird and obstacle colors. The game works by keeping the bird in the same x position and shifting the obstacles left every frame to make it seem like the bird is flying through the game world. The only dependency of this project is Cinder. 

Controls: Press the space key to make the bird flap and use a mouse to click on any of the game buttons.

Set Up: As for setting this project up, it is quite simple. As long as Cinder is working on your machine, you just need to download and open this project's zip and then run the flappy-bird app configuration. The game window should pop up with the game ready to play.
